# PCE-Prediction
The dataset contains US seasonally-adjusted personal consumption expenditures and the task is to compare the predictive ability of the following three models:
1)	`Drift` - A simple forecasting method
2)	`Holt` - An exponential smoothing model
3)	`ARIMA` model

The goal is to identify the best performing model by following these steps:
* Describe the steps and decisions made for the analysis (missing data, dataset split etc.).
* Present and interpret the criteria and the results for the selection of the best model.
* Plot the prediction of the models against the real values.
* Based on the findings make an estimation of the personal consumption expenditures for the month of October, 2024.
* Repeat and present only the modelsâ€™ comparison using this time a one-step ahead rolling forecasting without re-estimation of the parameters.
